# AnxietyBox

This is the Clojure project code to run anxietybox.com.

This project was discussed on the Reply All podcast in early 2015.
http://gimletmedia.com/episode/the-anxiety-box/

It runs at http://anxietybox.com.

## TODO

This thing is a hacky mess; it was my first attempt to get something
working on a website using Clojure. It worked, but it's badly
organized and undocumented. It's also tiny, and since I created it I
wrote probably 20,000 more lines of Clojure/Clojurescript, so it
should be possible to refactor.


## Prerequisites

You will need [Leiningen][1] 1.7.0 or above installed.
